# SDETAssignment

This repo is implemeted to test a password hashing API software.

**The module has the following major sections:**
----------------------------------------------

1. Bugs directory - it holds discovered bugs
2. API_Requests.py  - contains main request functions
3. TestCases.py - holds all the test cases
4. TestData directory - holds different test data.
5. Helpers.py - holds some helper functions

**Steps to run the test cases:
---------------------------**

1. Have python 3.6 or above installed
2. Install all project dependencies. You may install requirements.txt using: pip install -r requirements.txt_
3. In the API_Requests.py file, change the base_uri to your specific end point.
4. Test cases have priority. Test cases with priority 'third' need manual intervations to start the server when the server is shutdown by the test cases. 
    This process can be automated using a python or powershell script.
